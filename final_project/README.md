    #### Description:

    Overview:

    Welcome to our housing data analysis tool, which harnesses the latest housing data from Zillow to offer users up-to-date insights into average home prices across the United States. This user-friendly program enables users to input their desired location in the "City, State" format, and in response, it provides them with the most recent information on the average home price in that area.

    Smart Location Assistance:

    One of the standout features of this tool is its ability to provide intelligent location assistance. If a user enters a less populated area or a location not included in our dataset, the program doesn't leave them in the dark. Instead, it dynamically parses the user's input and generates a list of city names with available housing data in the same state. This thoughtful feature helps users make informed decisions by suggesting nearby metro areas with relevant data.

    Limitations:

    As of now, this tool is designed to work with US cities in the "City, State" format, as this format aligns with the structure of our dataset.
    The historical data provided covers the period from 2000 to 2023, giving users a comprehensive view of home price trends over more than two decades.
    Comprehensive Visualization:

    Beyond displaying the latest average home price for the chosen location, our program offers users the option to dive deeper into the data. Users can choose to visualize the annual home price trends, allowing for a richer understanding of the housing market. The tool generates a line chart that vividly illustrates the annual changes in home prices for the selected area over the past 24 years (from 2000 to 2023).

    Our housing data analysis tool empowers users with valuable insights, helping them make informed decisions about real estate. Whether you're a prospective homebuyer, a real estate investor, or simply curious about housing trends, this tool equips you with the information you need to navigate the dynamic housing market.

    User-Friendly Interface:
